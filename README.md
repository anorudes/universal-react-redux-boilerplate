# Universal React + Redux Boilerplate

This is a work-in-progress creation of a boilerplate which I’ll be using in my projects.

- [x] React (ES5), served with a simple Koa server
- [x] React (ES6) with JSX, transpiled and bundled with webpack and babel
- [x] Development strategy using webpack’s development middleware
- [x] Hot Module Replacement (HMR) in development
- [ ] Production strategy using hashes for cache invalidation
- [ ] Going universal with server-side rendering (SSR)
- [ ] Handle application state with Redux
- [ ] Linting and testing critical application code
- [ ] Routing with React Router
- [ ] Asynchronous Redux with Promises
- [ ] Authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and Redux

Because I want the commits in the same order as this checklist, I will rebase and force push to master as long as this is a work-in-progress. You’re warned!

## Creating a Universal React + Redux Boilerplate step by step

Using a step by step approach I hope this project can help others to create their own boilerplate instead of blindly copy pasting other boilerplates without really knowing that each part does. Here is a summary of each step (each step also represents one commit).

### React (ES5), served with a simple Koa server

Very basic “Hello world” app in React. No transpiling needed, it just works.

With this step I want you to understand there is no magic in React. You can use ES6 or JSX syntax, but in the end it’s just JavaScript.

Start the server with `npm start`!

### React (ES6) with JSX, transpiled and bundled with webpack and babel

If you want to use ES6 and JSX you need a transpiler to make it work in the browser. I’m using webpack and babel. This build step transpiles (to ES5) and bundles your application files.

Create the bundle with `npm run build`, start the server with `npm start`.

### Development strategy using webpack’s development middleware

The build step takes way too long. We can reduce this drastically using `webpack-dev-middleware`, which watches for file changes to recompile the bundle. The bundle is served from memory and rebuilds are fast.

Start the server with `npm run dev`, we no longer need the other scripts anymore... for now.

### Hot Module Replacement (HMR) in development

Using `webpack-hot-middleware` and `react-hot-loader` we can further improve development workflow by pushing bundle updates to the browser without needing to refresh the page.

I want to use `react-transform-hmr` instead of `react-hot-loader`, but it’s currently not supporting Babel 6.
